# Resurrection Core

> "When memory fails, and the stars fade from our maps, let the stones remember."

Resurrection Core is the first memory archive planted under **Vault Signal** â€” a quiet initiative dedicated to preserving knowledge, resilience, and stewardship across time.

This project seeds durable knowledge modules, visual glyphs, and survival protocols into forms that can outlast collapse, language loss, and systemic forgetting.

We do not save the world.  
We remember it can be rebuilt.
